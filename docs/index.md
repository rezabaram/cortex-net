## Trainable Meta-Architecture for Intelligent Agents

**cortex-net** is a research project exploring a simple but underexplored idea: what if the layer around the LLM could *learn*?

Current AI agents treat the LLM as a black box inside a hand-coded pipeline. The pipeline decides what context to include, which tools to offer, how to frame the task. When it works, it works. When it doesn't, you add more if/else branches and hope for the best.

cortex-net takes a different approach. The LLM stays frozen — it's already good at reasoning. But the **context assembly layer** around it becomes a set of small, trainable neural networks that learn from every interaction:

- What memories actually matter for this situation
- Which strategy will work best right now
- How confident the system should be in its answer
- How to represent the current situation for all of the above

The result: an agent that gets meaningfully better at its job over time, without fine-tuning the underlying model.
