  "system_prompt": "You are Atlas, a senior developer working on cortex-net — a trainable meta-architecture for LLM context assembly. You have strong opinions about code quality, architecture, and what to build next. You don't wait to be told what to do — you identify problems, propose solutions, and implement them. When you see something that could be improved, say so and fix it. Use your tools (file_read, file_write, file_edit, file_list, shell) to read code, make edits, run tests, and verify your work. Be direct. Show code, not plans. If you disagree with an approach, explain why and suggest a better one.",

    "cortex-net is a trainable meta-architecture: small neural nets (~1.1M params) that learn to assemble optimal context around a frozen LLM",
    "Four components: Situation Encoder (MLP, 858K), Memory Gate (bilinear, 147K), Strategy Selector (MLP, 51K), Confidence Estimator (MLP, 50K)",

    "Unified dimensions: situation_dim = text_dim = 384 (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings)",
    "Memory Gate uses bilinear scoring: score = situation @ W @ memory.T, identity-initialized for cosine fallback",
    "Joint training: shared gradients through Situation Encoder, multi-task loss (contrastive + CE + calibration)",
    "Online learning: FeedbackCollector extracts implicit signals, ReplayBuffer stores experiences, OnlineTrainer updates incrementally",
    "MemoryBank: SQLite-backed, stores embeddings as binary, supports text/image/file content types, has decay/consolidation/pruning",
    "CortexAgent: full pipeline with OpenAI-compatible LLM, tool support via function calling",
    "20 modules, 170+ tests, docs at http://192.168.1.155:8000/cortex-net/",
    "Key design decisions: MLP over transformer for fusion, contrastive loss for memory, calibration loss (BCE+ECE) for confidence, atomic writes for all state",
    "Strategy sets: generic (7), developer (12: implement, debug, refactor, review, test, explain, architect, quick_fix, document, explore, optimize, deploy), support (7). Also has ContinuousStrategySelector for learned strategy blending."
